---

The ABC of selling is ‘Always Be Closing’, this phrase/motto/concept is taught to
every salesperson in their first course. And it works great in B2C sales.
But it can act against you, if you’re involved in B2B. I’ll explain how and why.

title: WHY IT WORKS IN B2C SMALL SALES:

In B2C sales, especially Small sales, the risk of buying a product is low. For instance, if the buyer wants to buy a mouse, and the sales person keeps on trying to close the sale, it only creates a pressure on the buyer to make a decision on the spot. From the buyer’s angle, s/he may not be well informed of the product, and may have some questions. What you rather should do is to help him/her make a decision. Being aggressive and pushy can force the buyer to make a decision, but he/she can be very reluctant to come back again. So, you just lost a repeat customer. As a general rule of thumb, always make effort to convert a first-time buyer to repeat buyer, which helps grow long-term sales numbers. You might not recognize what went wrong in the small sales, because you’re in the high of a sale. The buyer doesn’t want to talk with you again, though. So you’ll never know being pushy affected your sales. When you are in transition from a B2C role to B2B sales because of your outstanding sales figures and promoted. If you employ the same techniques it only results to depression, as you’ve never realized some changes are needed to your techniques.

title: WHY IT WON’T WORK IN B2B:

Most B2B sales, have lengthy sales cycle, which may in some cases take upwards of a few months to years (e.g. Airplane sales). If you’re trying to close all the time, you put the buyer on the spot, to make a decision. These decisions take time to think, because it involves several steps and stages such as discussing with higher officials, working with other departments, keeping an eye on the budget, etc. There are several constraints and moving pieces involved in making a decision, when a wrong decision mean being unemployed. The risk of buying a product is quite high. As it also consumes your company’s resources and time, to best way to achieve a profit for your company is by trying to convert them to repeat customers.

The buyer needs enough value to justify the sale, and it is your job to show him. Due to the lengthy sales cycle, developing relationships is an important aspect of the sales, as the cycle continues even after sale.

title: Conclusion:

This does not mean you should never close, quite the contrary actually. First off, you should cover the buyer’s needs, clear any objections and educate him/her how well the product can help him/her, meet their requirements and then, only then use closing techniques to reach a commitment.
